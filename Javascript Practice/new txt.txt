Use simple javascript to solve following projects. Apply css to style the project. 

1.  Personalized Greeting App 
    Concepts:  Variables, Functions, Basic Input
   - Create a page that asks for the user’s name.
   - Use JavaScript to store the name and then show a personalized greeting like, "Hello, [name]! Welcome to my website!"

Steps:
1. Create an input box for the name.
2. Add a button that the user clicks after entering their name.
3. Use JavaScript to capture the name and display the greeting.

 

2.  Age Calculator 
    Concepts:  Variables, Functions, Basic Input
   - Build a small app where users can enter their birth year.
   - The app calculates their current age and shows the result.

Steps:
1. Ask for the user’s birth year.
2. Get the current year using JavaScript (`new Date().getFullYear()`).
3. Subtract the birth year from the current year and display their age.

 

3.  Even or Odd Number Checker 
    Concepts:  Variables, Conditional Statements
   - Create an app where the user enters a number.
   - JavaScript will check if the number is  even  or  odd  and show the result.

Steps:
1. Create an input box where the user types a number.
2. Add a button to check if the number is even or odd.
3. Use an `if-else` condition to display "Even" if the number is divisible by 2, and "Odd" if it isn't.

 

4.  Simple Calculator 
    Concepts:  Variables, Functions, Conditional Statements
   - Create a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers.
   - The user enters two numbers, selects an operation, and gets the result.

#### Steps:
1. Create two input boxes for numbers.
2. Add buttons for `Add`, `Subtract`, `Multiply`, and `Divide`.
3. Write a function that performs the calculation based on which button is clicked and displays the result.

 

 5.  Number Guessing Game 
    Concepts:  Variables, Conditional Statements, Loops
   - The computer picks a random number between 1 and 10.
   - The user has to guess the number. After each guess, the computer will tell if the guess is too high or too low.
   - Once the user guesses correctly, display "You guessed it!"

 Steps:
1. Generate a random number using `Math.random()` and store it.
2. Ask the user to input a guess.
3. Use a loop to let the user guess until they find the correct number.
4. Use conditions to check if the guess is higher, lower, or correct.

 

 6.  Counting Game 
    Concepts:  Loops
   - Make an app that counts from 1 to 10 and displays each number on the screen.
   - You can add a twist: the app asks the user to count along, and if they miss a number, it shows a message like, "Oops, you missed [number]!"

 Steps:
1. Use a `for` loop to count from 1 to 10.
2. Display each number in a list or in the console.
3. Add input for the user to guess the next number, and check if they are correct as they count along.

 



 7.  Temperature Converter 
    Concepts:  Variables, Functions
   - Create a simple tool that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
   - The user enters a temperature, chooses which conversion they want, and sees the result.

 Steps:
1. Ask for the temperature and whether it’s in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
2. Write a function that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.
3. Display the converted temperature.

 

 8.  Days Until Your Birthday 
    Concepts:  Variables, Conditional Statements, Functions
   - Ask the user for their birthday (day and month).
   - Calculate how many days are left until their next birthday based on today’s date.

#### Steps:
1. Capture the user’s birthday.
2. Use JavaScript’s `Date()` object to get the current date.
3. Calculate how many days are left until the user’s birthday (if it has already passed this year, calculate for the next year).
4. Display the number of days remaining.

 

 9.  FizzBuzz Game 
    Concepts:  Loops, Conditional Statements
   - Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100.
   - For every number divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead.
   - For every number divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
   - For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Steps:
1. Use a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 100.
2. Use `if-else` statements to check whether a number is divisible by 3, 5, or both.
3. Print "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" accordingly.

 

10.  Simple Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 
    Concepts:  Variables, Conditional Statements, Loops
   - Create a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer.
   - The computer randomly picks rock, paper, or scissors.
   - The user inputs their choice, and the program determines who wins.

 Steps:
1. Ask the user to pick rock, paper, or scissors.
2. Use `Math.random()` to make the computer pick a random choice.
3. Use conditions to compare the user’s and computer’s choices to determine the winner.
4. Display who won the round.
